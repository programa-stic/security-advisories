## 3. Vulnerability Description

Stagefright is a media library running in Android devices used as a backend engine for playing various multimedia formats such as MP3, MKV, MP4, etc. The library allows content providers to enforce digital rights management (DRM) licensing restrictions and constrains on end user devices by providing an interface to interact with DRM services running on the mobile device. 

A vulnerability exists in the library that is triggered when procesing video files that use this kind of protections of intellectual property rights (DRM) in Android devices. The bug can be used by a potential attacker to perform arbitrary operations on the victim device. 

In order to exploit the problem an attacker would need a victim to open an specially crafted video file with protected content. This could be done via sending an MMS message to the device, tricking the user into browsing a site controlled by the attacker or sending it via to app installed in the victim's device such as an instant messaging app.

The problem was assigned as critical severity by the vendor (Google) and it affects around 93% of Android mobile devices around the world.


## 4. Vulnerable packages

* Android Lollipop 5.1.1 and prior without October 2015 security updates.

## 5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

  Vendor fixed issue in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository on October 2015 and notified it's partners on September 10, 2015.

## 7. Technical Description

In libstagefright processing of media content with Elementary Stream based DRM (a MIME type string that starts with "drm+es_based+") is done by [http://androidxref.com/5.1.1_r6/xref/frameworks/av/media/libstagefright/MediaExtractor.cpp](http://androidxref.com/5.1.1_r6/xref/frameworks/av/media/libstagefright/MediaExtractor.cpp).

First MediaExtractor will open the data source and try to detect its type by iteration over the registered sniffer methods in DataSource:

```
53 sp<MediaExtractor> MediaExtractor::Create(
54        const sp<DataSource> &source, const char *mime) {
55    sp<AMessage> meta;
56
57    String8 tmp;
58    if (mime == NULL) {
59        float confidence;
60        if (!source->sniff(&tmp, &confidence, &meta)) {
61            ALOGV("FAILED to autodetect media content.");
62
63            return NULL;
64        }
65
66        mime = tmp.string();
67        ALOGV("Autodetected media content as '%s' with confidence %.2f",
68             mime, confidence);
69    }
70


```

For DRM-enabled content, this will end up calling SniffDRM() which will initialize a DRMClient to communicate with the DRMManagerService and create a DRMExtractor for processing the content.

```
75   if (!strncmp(mime, "drm+", 4)) {
76        const char *originalMime = strchr(mime+4, '+');
77        if (originalMime == NULL) {
78            // second + not found
79            return NULL;
80        }
81        ++originalMime;
82        if (!strncmp(mime, "drm+es_based+", 13)) {
83            // DRMExtractor sets container metadata kKeyIsDRM to 1
84            return new DRMExtractor(source, originalMime);


```

In the case of video content (AVC) with stream-based DRM, during playback the read() method in DRMExtractor will call in the decrypt method from the corresponding DRM service and process its output as shown below: 

```
126 status_t DRMSource::read(MediaBuffer **buffer, const ReadOptions *options) {
127    Mutex::Autolock autoLock(mDRMLock);
128    status_t err;
129    if ((err = mOriginalMediaSource->read(buffer, options)) != OK) {
130        return err;
131    }
132
133    size_t len = (*buffer)->range_length();
134
135    char *src = (char *)(*buffer)->data() + (*buffer)->range_offset();
136
137    DrmBuffer encryptedDrmBuffer(src, len);
138    DrmBuffer decryptedDrmBuffer;
139    decryptedDrmBuffer.length = len;
140    decryptedDrmBuffer.data = new char[len];
141    DrmBuffer *pDecryptedDrmBuffer = &decryptedDrmBuffer;
142
143    if ((err = mDrmManagerClient->decrypt(mDecryptHandle, mTrackId,
144            &encryptedDrmBuffer, &pDecryptedDrmBuffer)) != NO_ERROR) {
145
146        if (decryptedDrmBuffer.data) {
147            delete [] decryptedDrmBuffer.data;
148            decryptedDrmBuffer.data = NULL;
149        }

184                    break;
185            }
186

```

Decrypted video frames that include NALfragments will be pre-processed within the while loop at line 164. The loop concatenates and copies into a single buffer all the fragments, delimiting them with the 4-byte sequence  "\x00\x00\x00\x01", similar to the read() method of the MatroskaExtractor in Matroska.cpp.

The 'srcOffset', 'dstOffset' and 'nalLength' variables, all defined as unsigned 32-bit integers (size_t) are used to index into the input and output buffers for the copy operations. 

At line 180 'nalLength' is loaded as an unsigned 32-bit value directly from the input buffer (which was previously decrypted by the DRM service). 

At line 189 the provided 'nalLength' value is used for pointer arithmetic calculations to ensure that it does not exceed 'len' bytes, the allocated size of both the input and output buffers. However, since the check is performed on the sum of two variables of type size_t, a sufficiently large value of 'nalLength' will make the sum overflow and wrap around causing the condition to evaluate as false thus continuing processing with a nalLength outside the bounds of the input and output buffers. Then at line 208 'nalLength' is passed as the size argument to memcpy(), which will end up overwritting heap memory.

Note that exploitation of this bug for remote code execution would be extremely hard to detect or filter even on the Android device itself, since the vulnerability is only triggered after sucessful decryption of potentially malicious video frames. On the other hand, it seems to be an ideal bug for precise targeting and to avoid or otherwise impair incident forensics. Leveraging the playback restrictions that could be enforced using standard Android DRM services, an attacker could target exploitaiton to specific devices or during a specified timespan.
